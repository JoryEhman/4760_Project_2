    macOS (development), CLion 2024.2
    Linux (opsys.cs.umsl.edu – final testing environment)

------------------------------------------------------------

How to Compile the Project:
    Type: make

How to Clean the Project Directory:
    Type: make clean

------------------------------------------------------------

How To Run:
    ./oss -n x -s x -t x -i x

Command Line Options:
    -n x : Total number of worker processes to launch (minimum 1)
    -s x : Maximum number of concurrent processes allowed (minimum 1)
    -t x : Worker runtime duration in seconds (must be >= 0)
    -i x : Interval (in seconds) between launching processes (must be >= 0)
    -h   : Displays usage information

------------------------------------------------------------

Default Values:

If no arguments are provided:
    n = 1
    s = 1
    t = 0
    i = 0

If certain options are omitted, defaults apply.

Example:
    ./oss -n 4 -t 2

Results in:
    s = 1
    i = 0

------------------------------------------------------------

Testing SIGINT (Ctrl+C) and SIGALRM (60-Second Timeout):

To test signal handling and cleanup behavior, run the program with large
input values so it executes long enough to manually interrupt or allow
the 60-second alarm to trigger.

Example for manual Ctrl+C test:

    ./oss -n 1000 -s 5 -t 5 -i 0

Then press Ctrl+C during execution.

Expected behavior:
    - OSS prints the SIGINT cleanup message
    - All active child processes are terminated
    - Shared memory is detached and removed

Example for automatic 60-second timeout test:

    ./oss -n 1000 -s 7 -t 40 -i 0

Expected behavior:
    - Program runs until 60 seconds of real time
    - Alarm signal triggers
    - OSS prints:
        "OSS: 60-second timeout reached. Cleaning up and exiting."
    - All children are terminated
    - Shared memory is removed

Generative AI Usage: ChatGPT

Prompts Used:
    - “Explain in depth how each file interacts in a shared memory scheduler.”
    - “What would appropriate program output look like?”
    - “Help verify signal handling logic for 60-second termination.”

Summary:

    ChatGPT was used as a learning aid to better understand shared memory
    implementation, process control flow, non-blocking scheduling,
    signal-safe programming practices, and proper cleanup design.

    All code was reviewed, modified, tested, and fully understood
    before final submission.
