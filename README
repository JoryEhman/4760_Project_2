How to compile the project:
    Type 'make'

How To Run:
    ./oss

Example:
    ./oss -n 5 -s 2 -t 3 -i 0.5

Command Line Options:
    -n x : Total number of worker processes to launch (minimum 1)
    -s x : Maximum number of concurrent processes allowed (minimum 1)
    -t x : Total simulated runtime limit in seconds (must be >=0)
    -i x : Interval (in seconds) between launching processes (must be >=0)
    -h : Displays usage information

Default Values:
    If no arguments are provided: ./oss

Default values: n = 1 s = 1 t = 0 (no time limit) i = 0

If certain options are omitted, defaults apply.
    Example: ./oss -n 4 -t 2
    Results in: s = 1 i = 0

Generative AI Usage: ChatGPT
Prompts:
    - “Explain in depth how each file interacts in a shared memory scheduler.”
    - “What would appropriate program output look like?”
    - “Help verify signal handling logic for 60-second termination.”



Summary:
    ChatGPT was used as a learning aid to better understand shared memory
    implementation, process control flow, non-blocking scheduling,
    signal-safe programming practices, and proper cleanup design.

    All code was reviewed, modified, and understood before final submission.
